Responsive website clone


Some notes about it:

1. I had some social networks icons missing so i got them by myself.
2. At the header I've missed the gradient design. It wasn't in the assets folder. I can think of ways to do it (like transfort: rotate and overflow: hidden).
3. I've make the change-font-accessibility function to work (using REM strategy).
4. It was fun. Thanks :)
